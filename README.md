Hello, welcome to my new casino game!
This game is still in development so there might be bugs
The game is open source, you can try make your game out of it, or expand my code or make it simpler
Bugs might be present as I am still learning to code

In this file you will find info about how the game works and what which file or directory is for

About the game:
  The game is programmed in python 2.7
  The file called game.py is the main file and the game, it uses modules, most are default modules
  but one module is custom made, it is called save.py / save.pyc which it uses to save or read FILES
  to make the code more simple
  In the file run.py you can select what you would like to do (run the game, open readme, make a backup
  of a saved file, remove a backup of a saved file or place a backup of a saved file in /save folder)
  The game is about gambling money, having an income, and expanding your properties to let other people
  hire them to earn more income, you can also see your properties as an achievement or trophy for playing
  the game

About directory and files:
  The folder called save is where all player data will be saved in a .dat file, the game reads the file
  or saves data to it so you can shut the game off and continue a different time
  The folder called backup_save is where you can manually or with an upcomming script put some of your
  save files incase you are scared to lose data when the program crashes for example or incase you want
  to keep a file with old data
  the README.md file (this) is where you can read info about the game and much more
